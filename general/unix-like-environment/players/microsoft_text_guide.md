If you are using a Windows machine, you'll want to download Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSl). This is a basically a virtual machine that lets you run Linux on Windows.

It's really simple to install too. Just run `wsl --install` in your command line (cmd). You can use WSL at anytime by typing WSL in the start menu and clicking the top option.

Now that you've installed and opened WSL, download the file attached and run `./flag` in WSL in the directory you've downloaded the file to. You should see your first flag!

If you prefer, you can set up a virtual machine (VM) running Linux on your computer. This may be ideal for future projects, but is absoutely not required for this CTF. You can complete every challenge here using WSL.
