description: "Author: Dontmindme\n\nWelcome to Misc. The following few challenges are linked in a similar story, however, this is no ordering to these challenges.

The need for a creative thinking, your knowledge of computing, and your willingness to learn. 

We've managed to seize a malicious command and control (C2) server, which we believe was responsible for deploying malicious scripts onto the target machine. Among the files we found on the server are below, and we think there may be evidence here that we can use to get further into this evil network. Why don't you take a look at it and see if you can find something that could help us."
