Further, the techniques you will need to utilize to solve these challenges are completely unrelated. The only thing they all share? The need for a creative thinking, your knowledge of computing, and your willingness to learn. 

Let's get started. We here at Maple Bacon believe that a particular machine has been hacked, and we're currently working to get forensics and data on the compromised machine. A quick glance look at the machine found the following image of a famous singer-songwriter, which we found suspicious. Take a look at the image - can you find a hidden flag somewhere?"
