**Note: this is part 2 of the Arista Challenge. For this challenge, please submit the final flag file as a url, described below.**

## Foreword

This is a challenge developed by Arista for hiring purposes, so there are a few differences with our usual challenges

1. The flag file will contain a url, wrap that url in `maple{}` and submit that as the flag

2. The challenge involves multiple steps to retrieve the flag. _A few of these steps involve password bruteforce and network scanning_.  

3. All characters within the story are fictional. At no point is it required to research any names found within the challenge

## Challenge description

Several months ago you found a way to gain access to many of the emails going around UBC.
You started off packet sniffing to perform reconnaissance on the network and found out that
many of the emails are being sent in plain text! Email is best effort TLS so there must be a
misconfig somewhere.


You spend months digging through emails using regex’s and even a GPT-3 AI to look for
exciting information. Most of what you uncover is boring stuff: affairs, bribes for better grades, a
smuggling operation to ship in low quality United States maple syrup and rebrand it as high
quality Canadian product… One day you find something exciting

Subject: Tustin Jrudeau’s Twitter Account
  

Olivia,


We’ve gone back and forth on this for months. I have the password to PM Jrudeau’s Twitter
account and I can’t understand why you refuse to make him change it. As proof I sent you that
DM thread between him and the president of the United States!! I am getting increasingly
frustrated and am trying to resist the urge to use his account to post rude pictures. As a patriotic
Canadian this is a national security issue!


As proof I have hashed his (very easy to guess!) password and have stored it in a secure
location. I will send you instructions to access it over a PGP secured channel when you send
me your private key.


At my wit’s end,


m4pl3

Finally! Something involving cyber security! The ip address maps to a user server on the
university network! Intrigued, you begin to investigate…


The Arista CTF challenge begins by logging into a bastion host at 3.96.177.188.
You can ssh on port 65432 to this Linux machine using the following credentials:


Username: `saplingctf`


Password: `NC<.bb4H$7-9]@TdG]^<`"

connection_info: "ssh -p 65432 saplingctf@3.96.177.188"
