  Echo As Service

  echo is a pretty useful function, so I made echo as a service!
  
  Changelog:

  v0.5: How did these hackers get into my system?!?!? I'll add a filter to prevent this from happening again.

  v0.1: add a while loop to my service.

  v0.0: echo service prototype.
  
  Note: the libc library might be necessary in solving the challenge remotely. Remember to compare your local solution and change what's needed!"
