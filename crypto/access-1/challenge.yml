  Good job finding the secret bank exchange that APT-74 has been using, our next step will be to gain access and infiltrate their operations.

  We sent an operative to attempt to gain access and they were told they needed decrypt their message to gain access. Luckily for you they also managed to snag a copy of the source code used to generate the key and message.

  Do you think you can figure out what the key is?
